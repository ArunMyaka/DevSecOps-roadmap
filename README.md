# DevSecOps Roadmap

This repository documents my hands-on journey into Linux, Git, and DevSecOps.

What this repo contains:
- Linux fundamentals (files, permissions, users, processes)
- Git fundamentals (commits, branches, merges)
- Learning by doing: breaking things and fixing them

Approach:
- No copy-paste tutorials
- Everything tested locally
- Notes written in my own words

Goal:
- Build strong system fundamentals
- Prepare for DevSecOps roles with real understanding
